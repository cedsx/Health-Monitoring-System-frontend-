import React from "react";
import "assets/css/admin";

export const DashboardAdmin = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Admin Dashboard</h1>
    </div>
  );
};


// dito inalis ko yung export defaulr DashboardAdmin kasi diba pinaghamit ko sayo is BARREL FORMATTING like having a index.jsx in a folder so if using a import in anywhere in the APP is not do specific in  like adding the file but folder only to be called
